        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>TO MAKE THE GREEN SAUCE</strong>
        <p>To a blender, add the spinach leaves, basil, queso fresco, garlic 
        cloves shallot, walnuts, olive oil, evaporated milk and a pinch of shallot and few turns of freshly
        cracked pepper. Blend for 30 seconds to a mintues, scraping down the sides as needed.
        Give the green sauce a taste and adjust the salt accordingly (this type of cheese tends to be 
        quite salty so you may only need a pinch or two extra).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>TO MAKE THE PASTA AND ASSEMBLE</strong>
        <p>Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the pasta in the water and cook
            according to package's directions. Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup
            of pasta water. Add the pasta back to the pot and pour in the green sauce. 
            Toss the pasta until it's throughly coated. Feel free to add a splash
            or two of pasta water to the past to thin the sauce out a bit. Divide between
            bowls and garnsih with some queso fresco crumbles and freshly cracked pepper.
